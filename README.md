### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project was extremely helpful in two areas. First, as a css grid practice as this is something that I am still not that good at. Second, Helping me improve at figuring out how to divide up react projects into components and what to put where. Being able to do that in a css project where the react is just for show was really helpful since I didn't really have to worry too much if I needed to move something from one component to another.
